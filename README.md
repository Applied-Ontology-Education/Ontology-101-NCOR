# Ontology-101-NCOR

We hold a 6-week series designed to help participants build real-world ontology development skills through an active, hands-on learning cycle.

Each 6-week cycle follows a structured, practice-oriented format:
- Subject Matter Expert (SME) Engagement (2 meetings) – Practice eliciting competency questions, handling objections, and navigating challenging SME dynamics.
- Design Pattern Construction (2 meetings) – Model those questions into reusable visual patterns with critique and iteration.
- OWL Representation (2 meetings) – Translate your patterns into formal OWL in Protégé and test your models with reasoners.

This is effectively a hands-on workshop where we:
- Simulate stakeholder interviews
- Draft and refine competency questions
- Design and critique ontology patterns
- Build, test, and debug OWL files
- Engage in pair exercises and collaborative modeling
